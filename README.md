# advent-of-code

this is a compendium of all of the advent of code solutions I've written. for all the older ones, I copied the files into a new directory, because the old organization was kind of difficult to understand. For all of the rust solutions, they're submoduled to other github projects, and you can find the actual source code for each day in the src/bin/<day>.rs file.

none of these are full 25 day solutions (embarrasing...), but a lot of them are very close. the code quality on the older ones is almost definitely subpar. I have a good excuse though -- I was like 15.

check out the original repos for all of these:
- [rust-2023](https://github.com/rgodha24/aoc-2023)
- [rust-2022](https://github.com/rgodha24/aoc-rust-2022)
- [typescript](https://github.com/rgodha24/aoc)
- [python](https://github.com/rgodha24/aoc-old)

cloning the original repos will be a lot easier if you want to actually run any of these solutions.
